CMSC320 Final Project (Fall 2022)

## Introduction
[PlanetTerp](https://planetterp.com/) is an open-source student-run platform that allows students at the University of Maryland to publish reviews for their professors in the courses that they have previously took. The website aggregates all of this review data for any user to publicly access and search through.

Reviews have become a very critical part of any student's education, especially when trying to gauge whether a professor's teaching style is effective for the student. However, sometimes reviews might be more reflective of personal resentment rather than an objective view of whether a professor's class was fair and effective in communicating the course material.
